          Bright Lights is a multi-Grammy nominated singer, songwriter, DJ 
          and record producer. She has written for numerous 
          pop stars including Britney Spears, Justin Bieber, Usher and
          Beyoncé. Her catalog has amassed over 1 billion streams 
          worldwide. More than 100 million of those streams can be 
          attributed to her artist career and include such hits as Porter 
          Robinson's "Language," 3LAU's "How You Love Me" and her own 
          single "Runaway." She was also a featured vocalist on Zedd's #1 
          Clarity album. Her latest music video, "Put It Down," reached 1 million 
          streams in the first week, releasing independently. Bright Lights is

        “In an age where mainstream music is designed to be as
        easily consumed as possible, listening to Bright Lights is
        refreshing, to say the least. Her sound is perfect for radio
        but complex enough to separate her from other pop newcomers.”
