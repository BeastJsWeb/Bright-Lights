          and record producer. She has written for numerous 
          pop stars including Britney Spears, Justin Bieber, Usher and
          Beyonc√©. Her catalog has amassed over 1 billion streams 
          worldwide. More than 100 million of those streams can be 
          attributed to her artist career and include such hits as Porter

          single "Runaway." She was also a featured vocalist on Zedd's #1

          streams in the first week, releasing independently. Bright Lights is
